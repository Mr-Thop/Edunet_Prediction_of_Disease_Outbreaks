# Prediction of Disease Outbreaks

This Streamlit-based web application predicts the likelihood of three major diseases: Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson's Disease. It utilizes machine learning models to analyze user inputs and provide a diagnosis.

## Features
- **Diabetes Prediction:** Uses various health parameters to determine the risk of diabetes.
- **Heart Disease Prediction:** Analyzes multiple factors to predict the presence of heart disease.
- **Parkinson's Disease Prediction:** Uses vocal measurements to detect potential Parkinsonâ€™s disease.
